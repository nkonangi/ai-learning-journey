## What is a Vector?

A vector in machine learning is typically an array of numbers that represent a point in a high-dimensional space. For example, a feature set of a house (size, age, location score) could be represented as a vector $v = (1500, 10, 0.9)$.



## What is a Matrix?

A matrix is a collection of vectors, often used to store datasets. If we have 100 houses, our data would be a matrix of size $100 \times 3$.

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{pmatrix}$$
