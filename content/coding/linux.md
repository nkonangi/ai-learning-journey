Welcome to my Linux section! I'll be documenting my journey through the basic Linux commands to get familiar with Linux CLI here.  

Mastering the Linux command line (CLI) is a superpower for developers. It allows you to automate tasks, manage servers, and debug issues faster than any graphical interface.

Here is a curated list of commands essential for a professional workflow, organized by use case.
1. Navigation & File ManagementYou likely know ```cd``` and ```ls```, but professional environments require efficiency and precision.  
* ```ls -lah```: The gold standard for listing files.-l: List in long format (permissions, owner, size).
*   ```-a```: Show all files (including hidden .env or .git files).
*   ```-h```: Human-readable sizes (KB, MB, GB instead of bytes).
* ```pwd```: Print Working Directory. Essential when scripting or copying paths.
* ```cp -r source/ destination/```: Copies directories recursively. Without ```-r```, ```cp``` fails on folders.
* ```rm -rf foldername/```: Force removes a directory and its contents.

* Warning: Be extremely careful with rm -rf. There is no "Trash Bin" in the CLI. Once it's gone, it's gone.ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/link: Creates a symbolic link (symlink). This is crucial for server management (e.g., pointing a web server to the current version of your app).2. Searching & FindingAs a developer, you will often need to find a specific file or a specific line of code within a massive codebase.grep -r "string" .: Search for a "string" recursively inside the current directory (.).Pro Tip: Use grep -rn "string" . to include line numbers.find . -name "*.log": Find files by name. This example finds all log files in the current folder and subfolders.history | grep "docker": Searching your own history. If you typed a complex Docker command yesterday and forgot it, this will find it.3. Monitoring & Debugging LogsBackend development often involves staring at server logs to see why an API failed.tail -f error.log: Follows the end of a file in real-time. As new lines are written to the log, they appear on your screen instantly.cat file.txt: Dumps the whole file to the screen. Good for small config files.less file.txt: The professional alternative to cat for large files. It lets you scroll through a 2GB log file without crashing your terminal. (Press q to exit).4. Process ManagementWhen your server is slow or an application crashes, you need to investigate the running processes.ps aux: Lists all running processes.Usage: Often combined with grep: ps aux | grep node (Show me only running Node.js processes).top or htop: Shows a real-time dashboard of CPU and Memory usage.Note: htop is more colorful and user-friendly, but top is installed on almost every Linux machine by default.kill [PID]: Stops a process using its Process ID (PID).kill -9 [PID]: The "nuclear option." Force kills the process immediately if the standard kill doesn't work.5. Permissions"Permission Denied" is the most common error you will face.chmod +x script.sh: Makes a file executable. Essential for running shell scripts.chmod 755 foldername: Sets standard permissions (Owner can write; everyone else can read/execute).chown user:group file: Changes the ownership of a file.Scenario: You uploaded a file as root but your web server runs as www-data. You must chown the file so the server can read it.sudo !!: A magical shortcut. If you type a command and it fails because you forgot sudo, typing this repeats the last command with sudo.6. NetworkingEssential for testing APIs and connectivity.ping google.com: Checks if your server has internet access or can reach another server.curl -I https://api.example.com: Fetches the HTTP headers only. Great for checking if a site is up or checking caching headers.curl -X POST -d '{"key":"value"}' http://localhost:3000: specific testing of API endpoints directly from the terminal.ssh user@ip-address: Secure Shell. The standard way to log into remote servers.7. The Power of Piping (|)The true philosophy of Linux is creating small tools that do one thing well, and connecting them.The pipe | takes the output of the command on the left and makes it the input of the command on the right.Example Scenario:You want to see how many "Error" lines are in your log file.cat app.log (Read the file)grep "Error" (Filter only lines with "Error")wc -l (Word Count - lines)The Command:Bashcat app.log | grep "Error" | wc -l
